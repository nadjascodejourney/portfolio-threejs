# Three.js Portfolio with scroll-based animation 

inspired by Three JS Journey by Bruno Simons

This is a mockup for a simple Portfolio. 
My goal was to learn how to implement scroll-based animation and parallax effect with Three.js, guided by the highly recommended course by Bruno Simons.

``` bash
